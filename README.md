# AgriLift
Autonomous Agriculatural Collector

## Objective
To design an autonomous airship capable of lifting up to 350 kg bales.
Using the effective mass calculation:

    buoyant mass = mass × (1 − ρ_air/ρ_gas),
 
And the following assumptions of gas density:

    Air (ρ_air) = 1.292 kg/m3.
    Hydrogen (ρ_H2) = 0.090 kg/m3

1 cubic meter of hydrogen is effectively -1.2 kilograms. Therefore, to
completely offset the weight of a single 350 kg bale, ~291 cubic meters of
lifting gas is required.
