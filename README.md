# AgriLift
A Modern Autonomous Agriculatural Collector

## Overview
A major limitation on the economy of agricultural production is the 
ratio of yield to fuel costs. This is especially apparent in the production
of biomass for biodiesel production, where the fuel cost of transportation 
can potentially negate the value of fuel produced.

AgriLift aims to produce a viable alternative method to using large-bed trucks
for the transportation of biomass to regionalized processing facilities. By utilizing
Lighter-than-air technologies, solar power and natural atmospheric air currents,
an AgriLift collector can autonomously transport biomass while remaining completely
self-sufficient for fuel consumption.

## Objective
To design an autonomous airship capable of lifting up to 350 kg bales.
Using the effective mass calculation:

    buoyant mass = mass × (1 − ρ_air/ρ_gas),
 
And the following assumptions of gas density:

    Air (ρ_air) = 1.292 kg/m3.
    Hydrogen (ρ_H2) = 0.090 kg/m3

1 cubic meter of hydrogen is effectively -1.2 kilograms. Therefore, to
completely offset the weight of a single 350 kg bale, ~291 cubic meters of
lifting gas is required.
